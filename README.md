Late penalty: One week late due to a combination of GitHub trouble and the break. I'll only penalize for one day.

Overall comments on grading questions:

1) Does your site make the information easy to find?
    - Better than the original, but some things could still be easier.
    - I can't find when the BoE office is open.
    - I can't find who is allowed to vote in which elections.
    - I have to dig into PDFs to find the deadlines for registration/absentee/early voting in 2020.

2) Are the pages reasonably structured with HTML?
    - For the most part, yes.
    - The Relevant Deadlines and Upcoming Elections pages seem redundant.
    - Arguably the BoE address information isn't navigational (in the web sense) and shouldn't be in a nav.
    - Arguably the email addresses of the commissioners shouldn't themselves be items in the commissioner lists.

3) Are the pages tolerably styled with Bootstrap?
    - For the most part, yes.
    - The navbar seems under-utilized. Could have all your links up there.
    - Would be nice if the cards on the absentee page aligned in height, or else stacked vertically.
